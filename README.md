# Hello there and welcome:

Here you will find brief descriptions and links to my other public github projects, tutorials and general repositories which will have more feature complete descriptions, usage guides, etc.

## Projects/Tutorials:

None yet, coming soon!

## About Me:

For now though, a brief introduction to me as a developer.

  - I started coding at 13 in QBasic as it came with MS-DOS 5.0.
  - Moved to (Turbo) Pascal about 2 years later.
  - I have over 15 years of C/C++ experience.
    - Been tinkering and making small 2D/3D game engines for most of that time.
  - Now learning HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java and Python as I look to change careers.
    - Starting to make tutorials to reinforce my knowledge as I gain it and to help others, which I will link here later.
